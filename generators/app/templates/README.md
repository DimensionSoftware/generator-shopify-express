# Welcome To Your New Shopify App!

Remember to do the following:

* Create your own `.env`.  See `.env.example` for what it should look like.
* `bin/repl` will preload a node.js repl with this app's code.
  - Edit `.repl.js` to further customize what is preloaded.
* The `package.json` defines a bunch of scripts, but during dev, I prefer to run it by typing `bin/www.js` myself.
* This is heavily based on the contents of [shopify-node-app](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-app).

Enjoy.
